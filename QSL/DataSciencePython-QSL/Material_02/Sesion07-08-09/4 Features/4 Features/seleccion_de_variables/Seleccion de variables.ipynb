    "¿Por qué querriamos eliminar variables? Generalmente, cuanta más información tenemos sobre cada observación mejor será la calidad de nuestras predicciones (cuanto más sepamos, más facil será diferenciar unos casos de otros). No obstante, esto no tiene por que ser así en todas las situaciones, hay veces que ciertas variables pueden ser contraproducentes y hacer que nuestros modelos funcionen peor, por ejemplo debido a errores de medición.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seleccionar variables tiene varias ventajas. En primer lugar, como hemos dicho, puede mejorar las puntuaciones de los modelos (eliminando parte del ruido en los datos), por otra parte, reducir el número de variables independientes reduce la complejidad del modelo, reduciendo así el efecto de sobreajuste del modelo. Además, tener menos variables independientes y modelos más simples significa que nuestros modelos son más rápidos de entrenar, y podemos entrenarlos con más datos en las mismas máquinas."

RFE funciona seleccionando todas las variables, entrenando el modelo, usando los coeficientes `coef_` o la importancia de las variables `feature_importances_` en función del estimador, y eliminando n variables. Este proceso se repite hasta que se alcanza el número de variables deseado."
